# image-to-ASCII-text
Image to ASCII text converter using Python and PIL.

To view the ASCII text in windows cmd:
- Open cmd in fullscreen and print out the ASCII text.
- Right click on the top bar, then Properties, Fonts, change the Size to 5 or other smaller numbers.

The image is resized to width/2 and height/4 prior, because windows cmd displays characters 2 screen pixels wide and 5 screen pixels tall when Font size is set to 5.
